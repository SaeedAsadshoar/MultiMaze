Go to AssetData -> GameConfig for touch sensitivity and ball physics

Go To AssetData -> Levels -> Levels for add or change each level data

Go To AssetData -> Levels and select LevelSequence for add or remove or change level index

By select AssetData -> GameConfig you can change "Is Load Level By Object Prefab" state for load game from prefab object or vector graphics

You can Create or delete color palette for balls to. it will select randomly on each level load

Thanks
